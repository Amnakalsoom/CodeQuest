## Question 1: Banking System

### Scenario:
You're designing a banking system. Utilize interfaces and abstract classes to represent various account types such as savings account, checking account, and investment account, ensuring that common functionalities can be implemented while allowing for specific implementations for each account type?
##   Common Functionalities:
- Tax
- Transactions
- Pin Number
- etc

## Question 2: Game Character Hierarchy

### Scenario:
Design different types of characters such as warriors, mages, and archers. Each character type has specific abilities and behaviors. Use inheritance and abstract classes to design the character hierarchy while ensuring that each character type can implement its unique abilities.
### Hint:
- Character will be the Parent class
- Bahaviours are methods.
- abilities could be variables.

## Question 3: School Management System

### Scenario:
Develope a software application for a school management system. Design the classes representing different entities such as students, teachers, and courses. Common methods or functionalitis must be inherited while allowing for specific implementations for each entity type.
### Hints
- Department
- Names
- Timings
- Assigning user ids.
These scenarios showcase how OOP concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems effectively in Java.
