# CodeQuest

## Welcome to CodeQuest Coding Marathon!

Greetings, batch mates! I'm Abdullah, and I'm excited to introduce CodeQuest, our weekly coding marathon. This is a fantastic opportunity for us to enhance our programming skills, collaborate, and have some fun while diving deeper into the topics covered in our weekly PF class.

### How It Works:

1. **Question Submission:**
   - Every Friday, a Google form will be provided for you to enter your name, email, and a question related to the weekly PF class topic.
  
2. **GitHub Upload:**
   - All questions will be compiled into a file and uploaded on GitHub. You will receive a unique question ID for your submitted question.

3. **Code Submission:**
   - Participants have 24 hours to write code solutions for questions submitted by others. Upload your code on GitHub in your assigned folder, named by the Problem ID provided.

4. **Solutions:**
   - If you have solutions to your own question, please provide them in the form. Solutions will be made available on Sunday when the submission period ends.

5. **Review and Marking:**
   - After the submission deadline, you'll have time to check and mark answers to your questions in a provided sheet.

6. **Voluntary Participation:**
   - Participation in CodeQuest is entirely voluntary. This competition is organized within our batch for mutual skill development and enjoyment.

### Repository Structure:

- **/Questions:** Contains the uploaded questions file.
- **/Solutions:** Participants' folders containing their code submissions.
- **/Resources:** Additional resources related to the weekly topics.

### Getting Help:

If you need assistance in setting up your GitHub account or have any other queries, feel free to contact Abdullah via email at [maabdullah.rhs@gmail.com](mailto:maabdullah.rhs@gmail.com).

### Volunteers:

I am also looking for volunteers to help organize CodeQuest. If you're interested, please reach out.

### Disclaimer:

Please note that this competition is not affiliated with the university. The development work done in the industry is often shared on GitHub, making it a valuable addition to your CV as an IT professional.

Happy coding, and let the CodeQuest begin!
